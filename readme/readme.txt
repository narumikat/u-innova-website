Updating The Projects Section
The Projects section uses Isotope plugin which can be configured as described here https://isotope.metafizzy.co/

Adding A New Project
To add a new project in the projects section, you need to:
- Open for editing index.html and find the Projects section
- Here focus on the code area just below
<div class="grid">

- You can copy the following piece of code:
<div class="element-item erp">
    <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#modal1">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="images/project-1.jpg" alt="alternative">
        <p><strong>Orkla Foods</strong> - Complete ERP integration and replacement of legacy</p>
    </a>
</div>

- And paste it wherever you want your project to be in the Show All order
- Now replace the name and the image as per your requirements
- Also add it to a designated category. Now it's set for "erp" as you can see from the code but you can change it to any category you define
- You can also designate it to multiple categories, just add the category as a class name like "erp sfa crm"

Adding A New Category
To add a new project category in the projects section, you need to:
- Open for editing index.html and find the Projects section
- Here in the Filter section duplicate a line like the one below:
<a class="button" data-filter=".erp"><span>ERP</span></a>

- And replace the word "erp" in both locations with your category name
- Then also add it to the project line below
<div class="element-item erp">

- By replacing "erp" with your category name


-----------------------------------------------------


Change Testimonials Slider Properties
- Open for editing js/scripts.js
- Find the section /* Card Slider - Swiper */
- And then fiddle with the settings using the documentation here: https://swiperjs.com/swiper-api


-----------------------------------------------------


Update Statistics Number Settings
- To change the statistics numbers find the /* Counter */ section and update the data-purecounter-end="" attribute
- You can also set the speed of each counter with data-purecounter-duration="3"
- The count speed can be adjusted to have all counters finish almost at the same time
- If you give bigger numbers less time to be counted to then they will finish close the the smaller ones


-----------------------------------------------------


Change YouTube Video
- Open for editing index.html
- Find the Video section
- Then the Video Preview section
- And in this line of code
<button type="button" class="video-btn" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#videoModal" data-bs-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fLCjQJCekTs">

- Replace the YouTube video ID code "fLCjQJCekTs" with the one of your own video which you will find in the Share - Embed tab on the YouTube video page
- Replacing this image will update the Preview image: "images/video-preview.jpg"
